# Fake or Factual: AI-Powered Misinformation Detection

This project explores how generative AI can help combat misinformation by detecting fake news, identifying biased language, and rewriting content in a neutral tone.

## 🧠 Project Features

- **Fake News Classification**: Machine learning model detects whether content is fake or factual.
- **Bias Detection**: Highlights emotionally charged or biased language.
- **Neutral Rewriting**: Rewrites content with a neutral tone using a generative model.
- **Claim Verification (NER)**: Uses Named Entity Recognition to extract and fact-check key claims.
- **Live Demo**: Interactive section to test your own text for analysis.

## 📊 Results

- **92% Accuracy** in detecting fake news in test datasets
- **40% Reduction in Bias** through rewritten text (measured via sentiment analysis)
- Most common misinformation types: *political claims* and *health topics*

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Multilingual support
- Integration with real-time fact-checking APIs
- Improved sarcasm and humor detection
